    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a block of code that carry out a specific task and that can be reused when needed. A function generally need one or more inputs, which are processed to generate outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "So far you have already used many functions. `print()`, `sqrt()` and `np.sin()` are some examples. However, you can also create your own functions. These functions are called user-defined functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Defining a Function\n",
    "You can define functions to take inputs and convert them into the required output. A function in Python has four parts: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Function statement\n",
    "2. Function description (optional)\n",
    "3. Validation of inputs (optional)\n",
    "4. Computation code\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Function statement\n",
    "The function statement is the first line you write when creating a function. Every line of indented code below this line will be part of the function. The function statement begins with the keyword `def`, followed by: \n",
    "\n",
    "a. The function name\n",
    "\n",
    "b. arguments (or parameters) separated by commas, inside round brackets `()`\n",
    "\n",
    "c. a colon (`:`)\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a function statement is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def my_function(x):\n",
    "    \n",
    "where `my_function` is the name of the user-defined function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Function description (optional)\n",
    "The function description is a text that describes what the function does, what are the inputs needed, what are the input requirements, and what are the outputs produced. A good description includes also some examples of how to use it. This text is known in Python as `docstrings` and it is saved as part of the function documentation. Although this section is not compulsory, it should be always used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Validation of inputs (optional)\n",
    "The validation part consists of code to check if the provided inputs are in agreement to what the function needs. In other words, it is where the inputs entered by the user are appropriate to be used in the calculations. Although this section is not compulsory, a good validation of inputs is a must of robust and solid functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the inputs are not acceptable, it is possible to stop the code execution by issuing the statement `raise`. This statement is usually followed by an <i>exception</i> name, which helps to identify the type of error that occurred. Some of the base type errors are `NameError`, when the name of the variable is not defined, or `TypeError`, when the type of the variable is not of the expected one. The exceptions are functions that take as input a `str` containing the description of the error. Keep in mind that raising errors is not unique for input validation, but valid for handling errors. A description of the built-in exceptions are given in https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/exceptions.html#bltin-exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Computations\n",
    "The last part of a function is actually the code required to transform the inputs to outputs. In this block, the `return` keyword is needed to \"send\" the obtained output to the line from which the function was called. If `return` is empty, or if it is not issued, the function returns `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us see an example of a function with all parts that sums up the variables `a` and `b`."

So far you have used modules such as `numpy` or `matplotlib`. Keep in mind that to be able to use a module, the module has to be within the python path (`sys.path`), and in case its location is not available, it is possible to add it, by appending the location of the module to the path using the method `append`.\n",
