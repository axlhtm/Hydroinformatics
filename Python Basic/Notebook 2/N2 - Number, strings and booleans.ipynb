    "Data can have different types. Data types determines how a variable behaves and how it is stored by the system. In traditional programming languages such as C++, a variable must be declared before using it. This declaration explicitly assigns a type of data to the variable. In Python, however, it is not necessary (although it is possible), to explicitly declare the data types of variables. Instead, Python is able to automatically interpret which type is required, and what kinds of operations are possible.\n",
